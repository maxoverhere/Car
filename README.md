# Car-AI
A very simple 3D Engine for PS Vita made for my personal hobby/learning purposes.  
Currently is able to load simple .obj models + mtl file.

# Demo Compile
Download the repo with the following and make a build folder
```
git clone https://github.com/Jie-He/VEngine/
cd VEngine/Demo/
mkdir build
cd build
```
For OpenCV build (Runs on windows/linux if you have the OpenCV library):
```
cmake -DOPENCV=1 .. && make
```
For PSVita build (requires VITASDK)
```
cmake -DPSVITA=1 .. && make
```
The default build should display a rotating cube.  
Exectute the build with (For PSVITA, install the VPK): 
```
./VEngine
```
# Progress so far
